About Me:
I have a background in IT that stretches back to 1984. I have worked extensively with relational databases
and have worked for big name firms such as Unisys. I had to take some time away from the world of IT for
family reasons, but recently decided to use Code Nation to help me refresh my skills for the modern
workplace. I have learnt some Python basics which I have put to use successfully within
the course.





Purpose of IT in modern business.
The use of Information Technology within modern businesses has been viewed as an essential for decades. For
any business to be competitive they must embrace IT. The uses of IT include improving communication,
automating time consuming processes, and providing security to keep proprietary data safe. Good It implementation
will also lead to better employee satisfaction, moral and efficiency.




    

Methods, Skills and Resources

IT Project management is essential to deliver successful projects. Trello is a very useful tool to plan
and monitor projects throughout their lifecycle. It assists with visibilty for all memebers of a project team.
Effecfiency, productivity and stability are improved by incorporating an industry standard structured approach
to development. Team capacity and customer demand can be managed and aligned more quickly with tools such as Trello.

Relevant development skills will be required to make projects succeed.
According to Forbes, the most in demand languages are:-
1) Python
2) Java
3) Javascript
4) c#
5) PHP

Slack is the communication tool of preference for the IT industry.
Slack relies on channels and DM's as the two main methods of communications. Channels allow posts to be hashtagged
so that they are organised in a way that allows users to filter in relevant posts. DM's or Direct Messages allow for
users to connect on an individual basis

Planning and carrying out tasks:
Trello will be the choice of tool for creating the website. It will be used to break down tasks into individual
components, and these will be tracked through the stages of development (to do, doing, text version created, incorporated into website).

Risks in Digital Projects:
There are various reasons behind digital projects failing. A recent survey revealed that digital risk is a very widespread problem with
97% of compainies surveyed reporting that they had experienced digital project failure. Digital failure is strongly linked to the companies
overall performance.

A breakdown of reasons given for failure states that:-
51% - short term priorities took precedence leading to project slip
46% - unclear vision
51% - poor scope definition 
50% - trying to do too much at once.
39.5% - poor communication/siloing between IT and marketing

Technology selection:
where there is an industry standard in place, then it is only sensible to adopt that standard. For example, Slack and Trello are widely used
and have proven track records so it is desirable to incorporate these tools in digital projects. Where there is less clarity, i.e. there is more
than one dependable solution, then several considerations are factored in.

1) Ease Of use, Beginner friendly
2) Versatility
3) Performance
4) Scalability
5) Growth opportunity for developers
6) Tech trends

When the relative merits of one language over another are assessed within these categories, it should be easier to determine which language
is more suitable for your project.

Trello GitHub assessments
Trello has been a very useful tool for breaking down projects into manageable units. I have used it for both the Python RPG project and to
manage the necessary items for building the website for the CodeNation course. Github is very useful
