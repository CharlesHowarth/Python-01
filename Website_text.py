UNIT 1 OUTCOME 1
================

About Me:
I have a background in IT that stretches back to 1984. I have worked extensively with relational databases
and have worked for big name firms such as Unisys. I had to take some time away from the world of IT for
family reasons, but recently decided to use Code Nation to help me refresh my skills for the modern
workplace. I have learnt some Python basics which I have put to use successfully within
the course.





Purpose of IT in modern business.
The use of Information Technology within modern businesses has been viewed as an essential for decades. For
any business to be competitive they must embrace IT. The uses of IT include improving communication,
automating time consuming processes, and providing security to keep proprietary data safe. Good It implementation
will also lead to better employee satisfaction, moral and efficiency.




    

Methods, Skills and Resources

IT Project management is essential to deliver successful projects. Trello is a very useful tool to plan
and monitor projects throughout their life cycle. It assists with visibility for all members of a project team.
Effeciency, productivity and stability are improved by incorporating an industry standard structured approach
to development. Team capacity and customer demand can be managed and aligned more quickly with tools such as Trello.

Relevant development skills will be required to make projects succeed.
According to Forbes, the most in demand languages are:-
1) Python
2) Java
3) Javascript
4) c#
5) PHP

Slack is the communication tool of preference for the IT industry.
Slack relies on channels and DM's as the two main methods of communications. Channels allow posts to be hash tagged
so that they are organised in a way that allows users to filter in relevant posts. DM's or Direct Messages allow for
users to connect on an individual basis

Planning and carrying out tasks:
Trello will be the choice of tool for creating the website. It will be used to break down tasks into individual
components, and these will be tracked through the stages of development (to do, doing, text version created, incorporated into website,tested).

Risks in Digital Projects:
There are various reasons behind digital projects failing. A recent survey revealed that digital risk is a very widespread problem with
97% of companies surveyed reporting that they had experienced digital project failure. Digital failure is strongly linked to the companies
overall performance.

A breakdown of reasons given for failure states that:-
51% - short term priorities took precedence leading to project slip
46% - unclear vision
51% - poor scope definition 
50% - trying to do too much at once.
    39.5% - poor communication/siloing between IT and marketing

https://www.digitaldoughnut.com/articles/2018/september/why-digital-projects-fail

what is clear from researching this area is that project definitIon cannot be vague, as a lack of specificity leads to many problems. Also
if the resources that deal current business processes are being asked to implement new systems while performing their existing full time tasks,
then this can be a major source of risk

Cyber security is a constant risk that all digital projects face. A cyber security risk assessment is a useful tool to identify and mitigate
areas of risk.

Step 1: Determine information value
Step 2: Identify and prioritiSe assets
Step 3: Identify threats
Step 4: Identify vulnerabilities
Step 5: AnalySe controls and implement new controls
Step 6: Calculate the likelihood and impact of various scenarios on a per-year basis
Step 7: Prioritise risks based on the cost of prevention vs information value
Step 8: Document results in risk assessment report

Technology selection:
where there is an industry standard in place, then it is only sensible to adopt that standard. For example, Slack and Trello are widely used
and have proven track records so it is desirable to incorporate these tools in digital projects. Where there is less clarity, i.e. there is more
than one dependable solution, then several considerations are factored in.

1) Ease Of use, Beginner friendly
2) Versatility
3) Performance
4) Scalability
5) Growth opportunity for developers
6) Tech trends

When the relative merits of one language over another are assessed within these categories, it should be easier to determine which language
is more suitable for your project.

Trello GitHub assessments
Trello has been a very useful tool for breaking down projects into manageable units. I have used it for both the Python RPG project and to
manage the necessary items for building the website for the CodeNation course. Github is very useful for having good version control over code.
The pull request function ensures that conflict will not occur through multiple people working on the same code at once, and the History
option allows the user to view versions of code that have been submitted as development proceeds. Ensuring the process is in place to compel
users to keep Trello and GitHub up to date is a crucial requirement.







Legal Guidelines and constraints
The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is EU legislation covering the use of personal data.
If you process the personal data of EU citizens or residents then the GDPR applies to you. the fines for violating the GDPR are
extremely high so compliance is essential.


There are several principles underlining the GDPR:-
Lawfulness, fairness and transparency — Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.
    
Purpose limitation — You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it.

Data minimisation — You should collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified.

Accuracy — You must keep personal data accurate and up to date.

Storage limitation — You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose.

Integrity and confidentiality — Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption).

Accountability — The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.

Any digital project has to follow the above principles. For example regular data cleansing will need to take place to satisfy "Storage limitation".
Therefore the means to identify and remove data that is no longer needed has to be defined and implemented.

UNIT 1 OUTCOME 2
================

Were tools selected appropriate
I selected Trello to manage tasks within the project and found it entirely suitable.
I was able to break tasks down into units and keep track of their progress through the development life cycle.










UNIT 2 OUTTCOME 1
=================


Website constraints

Copyright is a potential source of risk for website development. Areas of potential copyright infringement include:-

Images
Source Code
Platform licensing

Images that are not free stock photos may be picked up by copyright detection tools, and if they are then the website
may be subject to a copyright claim against it. The actual source code behind websites can be subject to the same risks.
Some applications may be included within a website under a license. If the scope of the implementation exceeds the terms
of the license for the application then that becomes another source of risk.

https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/5-biggest-copyright-pitfalls-for-web-designers--net-14754


Other constraints include bearing in mind that the website may be visited on a number of different devices (eg laptop, phone,
tablet) and the site should work for as many devices as possible.


    
Website accessibility

Accessibility issues that should be addressed include:-
visual impairment
blindness
hearing impairment
People who struggle to use keyboard/mouse
People who find reading difficult

To resolve these issues the following can be done:-

Font size, style and colour selections can make text easier to read
Screen readers can assist the blind, so ensuring the screen reader is working correctly is of assistance.
Audio commentary may be needed to assist with video content
subtitles may assist the hard of hearing
Ensuring tabbing around a screen works smoothly will be useful
Ensuring that large blocks of text are broken up to assist with the page's readability

Appropriate file types for websites

HTML is the core of websites as it covers the basic text content for websites. and it tells the web browser
how to display text, images, videos etc on a web page.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is the file type that will control the manner in which text is presented. It provides a centralised
set of definitions that multiple pages can adopt, consequently saving the need to define styles for each page.


The web page may want to display images. The most common file types associated with images are .JPEG, .GIF, .PNG.
There are many other image file types available


Video content has several commonly used file types associated to it. These include .MP4, .WMV , .MOV , .AVI , .FLV
