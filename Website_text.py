About Me:
I have a background in IT that stretches back to 1984. I have worked extensively with relational databases
and have worked for big name firms such as Unisys. I had to take some time away from the world of IT for
family reasons, but recently decided to use Code Nation to help me refresh my skills for the modern
workplace. I have learnt some Python basics which I have put to use successfully within
the course.

any business to be competitive they must embrace IT. The uses of IT include improving communication,
automating time consuming processes, and providing security to keep proprietary data safe. Good It implementation

Slack is the communication tool of preference for the IT industry.
Slack relies on channels and DM's as the two main methods of communications. Channels allow posts to be hashtagged
so that they are organised in a way that allows users to filter in relevant posts. DM's or Direct Messages allow for
users to connect on an individual basis
